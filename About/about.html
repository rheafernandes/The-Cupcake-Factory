            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Cupcakes for all occasions! The Cupcake Factory is a unique bakery concept dedicated to achieving one simple
                goal. Every day, we handcraft the best cupcakes you have ever tasted.In early part of summer 2008, we opened
                our doors at Polkadots Cupcake Factory — a dream project of husband-and-wife team Olga and Ben. Olga graduated
                from University of Texas with a degree in Chemical Engineering from Cockrell School of Engineering in 2002,
                then continued her education at the California School of Culinary Arts in Pasadena, CA. Olga moved back to
                Austin and took on a day job working with a major consulting firm. While working for the firm during the
                day, at nights, she experimented with different recipes and developed delicious pastries which eventually
                became Polkadots cupcakes. After few years of being a corporate excel monkey by day, baker by night, she
                decided to ditch her button down suits and high heels to put on her aprons full time to create fun, whimsical
                cookies, cupcakes, and cakes.

            <h2>Why Us?</h2>
            <p>We have a wide range of gluten free and gluten full cupcakes! Why gluten free, you ask? There are many people
                who allergic to gluteneople with celiac disease can’t tolerate gluten, not even small amounts. Just 50 milligrams
                of the protein—about the amount in one small crouton—is enough to cause trouble. In people with celiac disease,
                gluten triggers an immune response that damages the lining of the small intestine. This can interfere with
                the absorption of nutrients from food, cause a host of symptoms, and lead to other problems like osteoporosis,
                infertility, nerve damage, and seizures.

            <p>Cupcakes are the perfect dessert for every occasion. Swirled and sprinkled, dipped and drizzled, or otherwise
                whimsically decorated, cupcakes are the treats that make everyone smile. Cupcakes are the star attraction
                for special days, such as birthdays, showers and holidays as well as perfect everyday goodies. No matter
                what the age of the recipients, these inspired creations will be such a hit, you'll need to make enough for
                seconds. Actually, make that thirds.
