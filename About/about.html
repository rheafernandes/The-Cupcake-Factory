            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Marvel Universe is a fictional universe where the stories in most American comic book titles and other
                media published by Marvel Entertainment take place. Super-teams such as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic
                Four, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Defenders, the Inhumans and other Marvel superheroes live in this
                universe, including characters such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Daredevil, The Hulk,
                Wolverine, Punisher, Moon Knight, Deadpool, Blade, Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange and numerous others. The Marvel
                Universe is further depicted as existing within a "multiverse" consisting of thousands of separate universes,
                all of which are the creations of Marvel Comics and all of which are, in a sense, "Marvel universes". In
                this context, "Marvel Universe" is taken to refer to the mainstream Marvel continuity, which is known as
                Earth-616 or currently as Earth Prime.
